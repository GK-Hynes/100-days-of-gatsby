[Netlify CMS](https://www.netlifycms.org/) is a headless CMS from [Netlify](https://www.netlify.com/), an amazing company that makes deploying and hosting JAMstack sites incredibly easy. 

If you want to try it out, there's a [Gatsby starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/starters/netlify-templates/gatsby-starter-netlify-cms/).

The Gatsby docs have a [guide to sourcing content from Netlify CMS](https://www.gatsbyjs.org/docs/sourcing-from-netlify-cms/).

And Netlify have their own guide for [getting started with Gatsby](https://www.netlifycms.org/docs/gatsby/).
